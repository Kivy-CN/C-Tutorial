I will generate comprehensive, well-commented code examples for each section of the tutorial, organize them into a `codes` directory, and update the `README.md` to include these examples and the missing sections (4-11).

### Directory Structure Plan
I will create a `codes` directory with the following structure:

- **`codes/03_structure/`**
  - `hello_world.c`: Enhanced Hello World with detailed comments on standard library, main function arguments, and return values.
- **`codes/04_types/`**
  - `binary_representation.c`: Demonstrates `sizeof` types, signed/unsigned behavior, and float precision.
- **`codes/05_flow/`**
  - `branch_prediction.c`: logic control, loops, and a branch prediction optimization example (using `__builtin_expect`).
- **`codes/06_pointers/`**
  - `memory_magic.c`: Pointer arithmetic, `malloc`/`free` usage, and common pitfalls (e.g., dangling pointers).
- **`codes/07_functions/`**
  - `stack_and_call.c`: Demonstrates pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference, recursion, and static variables.
- **`codes/08_structs/`**
  - `memory_alignment.c`: Shows Struct padding, memory alignment, and Union usage.
- **`codes/09_io/`**
  - `file_handler.c`: Standard file I/O operations (text and binary modes).
- **`codes/10_python_c/`**
  - `clib_math.c`: A simple C function to be called from Python.
  - `call_clib.py`: Python script using `ctypes` to load and call the C library.
- **`codes/11_security/`**
  - `safety_check.c`: Demonstrates buffer overflow risks and how to use modern compiler sanitizers (ASan).

### README.md Update Plan
I will modify `z:\Home\Documents\GitHub\C-Tutorial\README.md` to:
1.  **Update Section 3**: Link to `codes/03_structure/hello_world.c`.
2.  **Append Sections 4-11**: Since the current file ends at Section 3, I will append the titles and descriptions for Sections 4 through 11, each containing a brief explanation and a link to the corresponding code example in the `codes` directory.

### Execution Steps
1.  **Create Directory**: Create `z:\Home\Documents\GitHub\C-Tutorial\codes` and subdirectories.
2.  **Generate Code**: Write the C and Python files listed above with detailed educational comments.
3.  **Update README**: Edit `README.md` to insert the new content and links.
